# File Reference
What every `code##.js` file contains.
There are 20 total `code.js` files, and they contain the defining code for every scene of the game.
In addition to that, there is a file named `data.js` which contains all the definitions for assets of the game.
This can be useful for switching out sprites and motifying their identifiers.
In addition to that, the top of the file contains global modifiers that effect things such as the window size, screen orientation, fps, etc!

Note: if it has (???) next to it, that means that I am uncertain what the exact use of the file is.

1. Code 0 - Menu script
2. Code 1 - Level 2 script
3. Code 2 - Level 3 script
4. Code 3 - Level 4 script
5. Code 4 - Level 5 script
6. Code 5 - Error script (???)
7. Code 6 - Base engine script (???)
8. Code 7 - Level 1 script
9. Code 8 - "Done Script" (???)
10. Code 9 - Script for what order the levels go in and other related logic
11. Code 10 - Pause scene script
12. Code 11 - Possibly something for guns/shooting (???)
13. Code 12 - "ass_32idCode" (???)
14. Code 13 - "TIT_32CARDCode" (???)
15. Code 14 - Base script for scene, doesn't appear like the scene is in use
16. Code 15 - "CONCode" (???)
17. Code 16 - Appears to be a start up script (???)
18. Code 17 - Possibly something related to among us (???)
19. Code 18 - Game completion script
18. Code 19 - Same as .15, but there are some functions in the script, implying it is being used. What for, I do not know
19. Code 20 - "TIPZCode" (???)
20. Code 21 - Minigame scene's code

As you can see, there is a lot of uncertainty as to what some of these scripts do.
Feel free to make changes if you know what one does!
