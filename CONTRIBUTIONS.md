While contributions are greatly appreciated, please do not make a pull request to add or remove anything from the `PixelRailfight` folder.
If you want to contribute, add a guide. Or two. Guide topics that need to be covered include:

1. Detailed explainations every part of each code.js file
2. Information on different gdevelop functions & what they can do for us modders
3. How to add a specific thing (like an example)

Or whatever else you can think of! Most of the time, if I dislike a guide you've made a pull request for, I will edit the file to be how I'd want it to be. 
So don't be supprised if there are slight changes to your guide after it gets added :)

Formatting:
1. Every guide needs to be in the markdown `.md` format
2. Make sure to break your guides up into chuncks using headers
3. Don't worry about specifics I'll edit the guide if it isn't in the best of shape

Thank you for your contributions! (or, just checking this project out :)!)
